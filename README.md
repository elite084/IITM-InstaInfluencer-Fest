# IITM-InstaInfluencer-Fest
C++ mini project simulates the IITM InstaInfluencer Fest using a directed graph of event dependencies. It employs DFS for cycle detection, Strongly Connected Component (SCC) analysis, and topological sorting to manage event flow, and uses dynamic programming on the DAG to compute the maximum hype score showcasing advanced algorithms and OPPS.
